# 🧠 Explainable AI with ResNet50: Cats vs. Dogs 🐱🐶

## 📚 Project Overview
This project explores the inner workings of a **ResNet50** deep learning model when classifying images of **cats** and **dogs** using the **CIFAR-10** dataset. The aim is to understand how the model differentiates between these two concepts through various **explainable AI (XAI) techniques**, including:
- **Concept Activation Vectors (CAVs)**
- **Saliency Maps**
- **Integrated Gradients**

## 🧪 Research Hypothesis
- **H0 (Null Hypothesis)**: The ResNet50 model does not show a significant difference in its sensitivity to the concept of "cats" compared to "dogs".
- **H1 (Alternative Hypothesis)**: The ResNet50 model shows a significant difference in its sensitivity to the concept of "cats" compared to "dogs", specifically, it learns features more effectively for one over the other.

## 📂 Repository Structure
The repository is structured as follows:
- `Explainable_AI_ResNet50_Cats_vs_Dogs.ipynb`: Main Jupyter notebook containing the analysis, code, and visualizations.
- `README.md`: Detailed project overview, and usage instructions
